This project is current as of the end of Sprint 4.

The project currently includes:
- Start Screen
- Player Configuration: User will input their User Name, Difficulty Level, and Sprite color.

- Player functionality: Player can move around the game map and avoid obstacles to incrememnt score.
- Vehicle implementation: Vehicles move across the road tiles to serve as obstacles for the player.
- Score count and display: Score increases as the player moves across the map and avoids obstacles.
- JUnit tests: Tests created for the functionality of the player configuration and player movement.
- Collisions: Player collides with vehicles and the river, losing lives and score, and game goes to game over screen when all lives are lost.
